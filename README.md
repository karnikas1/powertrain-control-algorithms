This repository contains MATLAB scripts and models for exploring different motor control and driving loop algorithms in the context of an FSAE-style electric race car.

The goal is to simulate and compare control strategies — focusing on torque limits, regenerative braking, thermal derating, and energy recovery — to understand how they affect motor behavior and vehicle performance.
